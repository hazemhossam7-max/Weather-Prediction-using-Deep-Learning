## ☁️ Weather Prediction using Deep Learning

This project forecasts weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed using deep learning models on historical climate data.

### 📂 Dataset
- Historical weather/climate dataset (CSV format).
- Features: temperature, humidity, pressure, wind, etc.

### 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values and normalization.
   - Splitting data into training/testing sets.
2. **Model Training**:
   - LSTM/GRU networks for sequential time-series prediction.
   - Comparison with baseline regression models.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - RMSE, MAE, R²-score.
   - Visualization of predicted vs. actual weather conditions.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook to train and test models
